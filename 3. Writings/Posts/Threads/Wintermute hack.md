The initial cause of the hack is from a bug in the Eth vanity address generating tool Profanity

## Thoughts
Reading over the wintermute hack some more, pretty interesting that Profanity chose to use random 32-bit vectors to seed 256 bit priv keys. allowing anyone with a lot of GPUs to brute force the addresses themselves

Most interesting here is that this is a relatively simple process for ppl with a lot of gpus to do, maybe even just optimize for richest wallets and then go for those?

or test with a few gpus and see what hits first

This github issue talks about what this process would look like for a gpu

Mewn comments on how current wallet infrastructure won't necessarily  improve without governance inclusions

The followup on the initial tweet is pretty similar to creating a multisig with different devices and addresses you maintain to act as a set of guardians, i think degenspartan talked about this awhile ago

honestly similar process i've used for gnosis safe and managing funds without having a cold wallet. this is a must tho, would be 10x easier for my life to have a gridplus right here smh
