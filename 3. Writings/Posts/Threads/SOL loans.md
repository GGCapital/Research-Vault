## Initial Twitter post
repaid my loans from depositing $sol & mSol into Port at 240-250 (improving on mistake i made last two rallies at 58 & 210)

borrowed pSol against it, swapped for usdc to stable farm with on saber and now swapped +usdc value for pSol at 152

roughly 63% :)

### Summary

here im identifying one of the main trades i attempted to do over the past rally
- ended up missing on initial rallies this year and was a true bagholder which is ridiculous
- decided to put together this plan specifically using defi protocols to earn on my tokens without being stricken to overall market performance
- ideally i should have been more focused on this and not spread bread around everywhere bc i ended up losing track of a lotttt of it

### Thread

1. deposit 100 sol into port finance @ $250/Sol
	a. can also use this example with marinade and earn on msol deposits
2. use 100 sol/mSol to borrow pSol or sol deriv against the 100 sol collateral, current value would be $25k (also depends on the borrow value that each platform will give you, Port is 80% or so)
3. now with borrowed pSol, swap for usdc (lets say you can only borrow 80 pSol from platform) 80 pSol x $250 = $20k usdc
4. free $20k usdc, just dont lose it all and your taking the risk of a sol victory rally if sol runs from let's say 250 to 300 in a day
5. instead of diversifying to different assets, most conservative route is simply stable coin farming with the $20k usdc 
	1. great place to start is saber with farms giving out 40-50% apr for stables
	2. another easy route is using mercurial for stable farms
	3. or if you're really godtier you can deposit the usdc into mango or drift to trade with
6. now when it's time to pay back your loan, for instance Sol here at $152 -> your 80 sol that you have to pay back is now worth $12.1k
	- this means that you now have an additional $8k in profit just from borrowing against the asset
	- AND you get back your original 100 sol that you deposited
7. so with 100 sol back in wallet and additional $8k still stable farming, you've avoided the worst of the downturn and still have the option of selling your tokens back into stables
8. the alt route here is simply selling everything at highs, which is less risky, but doesn't take advantage of defi protocols allowing you to leverage your assets
9. even still, i wouldnt outright tell people to follow this same plan esp if you're extremely new to the space as i fell victim to shiny object syndrome along the way...
10. and ended up wanting to split up the borrowed assets across different ecosystems
	- which of course worked great, s/o avax and jewel
	- but this doesnt take away from the fact that it almost leaves capital sitting in the platform if you dont have a dedicated plan/structure for entry/exits
11. one route to truly profit from this can be using Drift and your borrowed Usdc to trade perps with -> shorting sol at 250 and vibing, then using extra profit now to pay back loan and vibe more
