# UX Issues with DeFi

## Example
### Wallet UX Issues
Just had a miniature freakout because I thought I got hacked and couldn't find my Usdc on arbitru, Found out that Debank and Rabby took it off of the apps? At first I thought someone had stolen usdc.e on avax but then I realized that I had sent all of that out

And now I just said create a new account on Metamask and...it gave me the GGCap address????? wtf is going on here, is this shit rigged?!?!?

I dont want to trust metamask off of this shit as well, doesnt seem worthwhile

I wanted to add a new signer for the crypto bank gnosis safe since that would protect against rabby getting hacked as transactions would need rabby and metamask wallets to access funds. Now I've never seen this before but why tf would Metamask use my old address that I haven't loaded on here as the new account creation.

The next fucking address it adds is...none other than fucking Harmony multisig wallet signer...WHAT IS HAPPENING
0xbE3225928280Dd93F0B22E4074b545EA320FE1Fb

Now just went to go check out the harmony multisig bc it was the same address added toMM?? Now when I go there this address is what is Loaded, never used it before to my understanding 0xB4e8D642233bEFa5621B34d3f4Bfd548870F1557

Now next one I added was the 0x1d2Caf8c57c2A7AEfb335917d2955Af63fDfBc56 address, this is Jewelboyz main one?? official treasury just from creating an account...

## Draft

For explaining why to make these easy to use:

Lots of people might have a problem with the amount of inefficiencies present with DeFi protocols and their native dapps. Now that the importance of self-custody is even more evident, I went through a few of the most common tools and chose key issues that new users might fall victim to.

Frontend platforms like DeBank and Zapper are often used to display portfolio balances across different chains. Frequent use has been argued against since you're relying on their frontend for viewing your assets.

One downside to this is if a platform doesn't have a certain token address or god forbid they decide to remove access. Imagine my disbelief waking up one day and seeing that my USDC has vanished, both on DeBank & on the browser extension wallet Rabby. If I wasn't able to confirm tokens thru block explorers or hardware wallets like Ledger

Next is creating new wallet addresses to transfer assets to or hide previous money trails. With M^tamask as the most commonly downloaded wallet, it would make sense that people would use it to create new accounts as they experience various protocols. 

What if you had a set of old addresses on Metamask, maybe on a different browser, and you re-downloaded Metamask on a new browser (Going from Brave to Chrome or vice versa)

You would expect that those old addresses would be lost in the ether, only recoverable by their secret recovery phrase/private key. Right?

Imagine my dismay when loading up a new MM, creating a new account, just to see my old addresses reappear in the wallet. Whether paranoid or not, one has to realize that in the off-chance that your laptop is stolen after you've deleted your web3 wallets, someone could simply redownload MM and gain access to all your previous wallets.
