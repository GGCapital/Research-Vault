**my thoughts on maximizing profits in defi:**

I love reading original whitepapers because they describe groundbreaking ideas in a world where there were no easy comparisons. True first principles thinking.  

Understand these 5 concepts and you'll see most of DeFi is forking, remixing, and iterating on these ideas.



for airdrops, this is one of the fun parts of crypto imo, literally getting rewarded for just using a platform has been so beneficial this past year. airdrops are all different tho, you never know what a protocol might choose as its "snapshot"

normally i tend to just swap on new exchanges, toss couple 100 in a few wallets and farm on a new platform (what we did for jupiter, apricot finance and francium in prep for their airdrops) 

for bridging, really just started after the GB airdrop from using the Avax bridge (honestly just bridged from multiple wallets, each one got same amt) that i realized getting exposure to other chains before ze masses reach them is key

like cool solana is now considered top tier asset as it should be, so now i gotta go back to deep sea aka discord diving to find the new gems on other chains. best way to do that will be using new projects thru different bridges and various wallets in order to maximize exposure. can still have minimal risk but its key to find places where you can still profit on the chain

for finding said profit, to me that's mostly gonna be finding the most prominent dex or base layer project on the chain and then apeing with that and the native token. 

spend profits on the shitcoins of the eco, all of em will have some coin that runs 50k% (case in point Hatter drop yesterday at 1pm https://dexscreener.com/avalanche/0x8b784e6f4525283caec73e031231f0b319c5232c basically fucked up the network and ran 96k% or something like that lol was fun playing it and just watching the chart) and then take ze gains from that shitcoin and flip it for more of the native token, avax in this case

from there you can create set stockpiles of each chain and then wen new project, ape, flip for native token, or if you have conviction (me with jewel) just stick with that project since it's more than likely to perform similarly or sometimes outperform the native token

once you've hit a few 10xs on a new chain you can start farming across each of these protocols. for example, jewel-one and jewel-mis lp were the first pools i participated in on harmony, which was initially earning 18k-24k% apr and then paying out in unlocked and locked jewel. from there you could compound your lps daily or stake them in the bank to receive xJewel. 

if you started with defikingdoms from at least september, early october, you would have created a pretty hefty treasury whether that was paying out thru the farms themselves or earning voting rights and raffle entries  thru staking in the bank. now, what makes this so much more intriguing is that the game built on top of the dex is *gasp* actually good lol

so now you can use your profited jewel and start buying heroes and questing within the game to increase your collection. some of these heroes have gone from a $400 floor to a $70k floor for Gen 0 heroes. from here you can begin implementing more of your gains into the bank and the farms and keep racking up
