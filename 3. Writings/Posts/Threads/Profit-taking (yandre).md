1. 1/ so i had a friend recently ask me about performance with his investments, mostly holding assets, determining entries/exits, etc and i think it's something that many lose track of during such a crazy year (myself included)

2. 2/ will be brutally honest, i've fumbled many bags along the way, but what i've realized is that during each moment of euphoria i've now had to force myself to sell, esp once hitting portfolio or token ATHs.

3. 3/ However, where i think ppl mess up on is not having a plan for *when* to take profit in these moments, as even fading euphoria isn't enough. 

	that moment where you're on top of the world? yeah maybe fade that a bit    https://twitter.com/blknoiz06/status/1379593392162799619?s=20

4. 4/ One method that clicked for me recently is understanding inefficiencies in the market. listening to @jordialexander explain these in a recent UpOnly podcast revealed that these patterns occur bc of market participants.

5. 5/ to me this can refer to very new entrants into the market or simply the repetition of patterns regarding capital flows and our lovely rotations between sectors. more often than not these are based on narratives ;)

6. 6/ for example, we can infer from Alt L1s that sentiment and memes rise with new highs and then tend to sell off following initial rallies. Ideally, you want to start planning exits or reducing risk as these moments become more feverish.
7. case in point being solana summer, the avax bridgeoorss, $spell and the frog nation, etc., all suffered -40-80% dumps during peak moments of euphoria.
7. from a victim perspective, and what i learned from the most, was that initial plans can always change in this market. imo you should always go back over a thesis as the market changes, instead of remaining complacent when one goal is reached
8. i remember how ecstatic i was to see sol at $100, whereas my plan was to sell a decent chunk and farm the rest. https://twitter.com/YohanGGlobal/status/1427138841585008640?s=20
9. great plan right, until we chugged right on to $200+, which felt amazing but nearly froze me in my place as i couldn't register what would happen next.
10. instead it took a friend @stun pulling up the monthly chart and pointing out how unreasonable such performance was. even then, i couldn't stop from bagholding the rest of my $sol down to sub $150 after its first pop above $200, thinking that if i sold some spot i'd be fine.

8. by that time, price had plummeted nearly 40%, yet the mentality of "it's still up 700%" kept replaying again and again, which is just idiotic in hindsight

9.  end of the day you shouldnt let money fool you, esp when its just a token. at that time, i hadn't seen profit anywhere like this before and had to learn my lesson the hard way.
10. so, i wrote what happened down and really had to look back on how i felt in that moment. @cobie pointed out a great part of this in his recent article, where one's focus in this space (esp if you're new) shouldn't be to get rich quick.

12. instead, it should be maintaining an edge or securing profit when considering how likely a possible outcome is. any token up 1000% is bound to lose some steam, and it's okay to miss out on an extra couple %'s 
13.  applying this lesson back to $sol, i wanted to sell at the next psych number (either 250 or 300), so i set alerts and prayed i would have some sense by that time. 
14. the second we reached the first level, i sold as much as i comfortably could and deposited into @port and @apricot to borrow against for the next narrative
15. end of the day, there will always be more of these types of ups and downs but its important to take note of what happened in prev. rallies and then apply said knowledge to the next one.
16. take a step back and although mistakes might become more clear in hindsight, write them down *every* time so that you're prepared for the next time you're caught off-guard.

## summary
### question to answer
I've been struggling with my investment performance, mainly with how long to hold investments, when to sell, when to enter, etc.

1.  i aint gon lie i fumbled the bag with a lot of shit tbh, got to the point where i basically had to push myself to sell my shit, got to that euphoric moment of portfolio ath and was like shit i gotta stack some of this shit
    
    i think Z spoke on this a bit today too, when you're feeling incredible is when you should start trimming a bit lol
    
    for holding shit i mean i think rn i've just been playing sol and harmony, majority was in sol, rotated a decent chunk out and sent to dfk, then kept remainder either staked, farming or in ftx just waiting to deploy
    
    mostly just added to longterm btc and eth stack in my trezor and let that shit sit but i often wonder when i'll ever sell a lot of shit
    
    id say first and foremost its unbeliavbely important to at least have some type of plan set up before you start buying some shit
    
    like i had been calling for $100 sol for a pretty long time and when that hit, i sold a bit and kept farming with the profits to get ready to deploy on the next run
    
    after it ran to 220 or so and i didnt sell, basically hit me that i shouldnt let money fool me, esp when its just a token. so then when we went to 250 or so this run, i sold as much as i comfortably could and dumped the rest into port apricot solend etc to borrow against if needed
    
    think we still see more of these types of ups and downs but its important to take not eof what happened in prev rallies and then apply said knowledge to the next one
    
    oh yeah look back over Z's yearly plan too, that really helped a lot
    
    `im gonna try and make one of those by end of year, should be your first priority so that you can understand what may have been wrong the past few weeks`

	1.  So it’s all about knowing when to pivot and change your thesis. I think my issue is I don’t have a thesis lol I just trade price action and easily get shaken when price deviates a lil but
	2. if this is normally the case for ppl you should be focused on improving your overall mentality regarding new positions and why you want to be in a trade
	3. what becomes even more interesting to me is understanding why you may not what to take profit. Whether twitter's changing sentiment on you or you've gotten a feeling of euphoria can be key in comprehending  when it's time to take a step back
