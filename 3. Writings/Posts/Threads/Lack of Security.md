I've come to realize that ppl will reveal their entire life stories on any/all flights to any location

This kid next to me is literally showing his passport to a random girl, not caring about any private information being shared, not caring about me seeing it...

Maybe personal privacy is unimportant to the youth or it's of no interest? Just a slight glance at passport number or social security and isn't that wraps?

It could just be that there are those who feel protected or it could be the vulnerability that a flight buddy ensures in people

This somewhat reminds me of a joe Rohan podcast where the hitchhiker was able to find out so much about people just from asking wuestions

As the flight gets closer to its end, they get more and more personal with questions and answers. As if it's intended for both parties to share their deepest secrets in a ploy to enjoy conversation

If that's the case, then what holds people back from revealing their finances to one another? From there, leading to the inevitable hack or exploit when a little *too* much information has been revealed
